# ml-model-frontend

This repo contains my progress for the [DIY Frontend for your ML model](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md) project. 

The idea is to create a book recommendation system using this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset).
